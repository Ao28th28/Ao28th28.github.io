Version 1.3.1 is not the same as in 2014 yet!

Old Prodigy English is coming soon!

## Versions choice list!

List of versions informations:

- 1.3.1 | Version 1.16.5

This is almost 1.16.5, not the one that JordanHH used.

- 1.8.9 | Early 2015 Beta Testing

This was supposed to be in early 2015, but we think that nobody saw this version.

- 1.9.0 | March 2015

This is almost like the real 1.10.0, but it's modified like the other versions I have.

- 1.10.0 | March 2015

This was supposed to have the assets for most zones, but Prodigy Education took them down. Credits to Prodigy Education, Daboss7173 and more.

- 1.11.0 | April 2015

This is the first version with Clockwork Town.

- 1.12.2 | The oldest version that can run essentially flawlessly.

  Now don't get me wrong, this isn't the oldest version of Prodigy ever, but it's pretty old! Lots of old elements around that aren't seen in newer versions.
  
- 1.16.5 | The oldest version with all of the legacy quests, and the element selection.

  This is a version that I recommend in particular, it's kind of like 1.11.0 - but it's generally a lot more stable. In fact this version
  is one of the most stable Prodigy versions on this site!

- 1.17.0 | The oldest version with tileset-style maps!

  This version was the first to introduce an old tutorial from 9/8/2015, more in-depth than 1.16.5 and before, which would end up being used all the way up to 1.30.0!
  Not only did this version have that, but it also introduced the precursor to the modern firefly forest (before they updated the tileset and updated Flora's sprite)

- 1.24.0 | A whole lot of stuff added in!

  This version introduced the new Shiverchill Mountains quests, a new tile-based Lamplight town, as well as a LOT of new menu designs added in.
  Pretty safe to say a LOT happened between 1.17.0, and this version.

- 1.30.0 | Just as many radical changes!

  This version had the updated Skywatch, the updated Bonfire Spire, AND an updated map screen! This version also introduced achievements and all kinds of
  other, more subtle changes. This version is another one that I really recommend trying out, another definitive update.

- 1.37.0 | New Lamplight Town and tutorial!

  This version had a brand-new tutorial, which is the base for the MODERN DAY Prodigy tutorial, even though it's been changed in multiple ways, the resemblance is
  uncanny! This also brought in the modern-style Lamplight Town, now some things are arranged differently, but it's still essentially the same. This version
  also has Winterfest, which is pretty cool if you're interested in that.

- 1.39.0 | Crazy battle update!?

  This version introduced a refresh on the battle system, with a new health meter not using hearts, but a health bar! It also shows how much damage is dealt in
  each attack, and introduces critical hits. This also has leveling up mid-battle and some new animations to accompany this! This version also has the Firefly Forest reskin,
  which looks really cool!

- 1.50.0 | Lots of significant changes added in!

  This version has a lot of significant changes, For starters EPIC ATTACKS are added now, along with some new battle sound effects! The tutorial route was also re-worked
  a bit, and now it uses a shorter route that doesn't take you through Lamplight Square and is overall less drawn-out. This is yet another version I truly recommend,
  in my opinion, it is one of the definitive Prodigy versions.

- 1.51.0 | NEW AVATAR!? EW!

  This update has always been a bit controversial... The avatar was completely reworked in this version, and instead of using sprite sheets, it used atlases. This means
  that the animations could be a LOT smoother than before! However, it just plain didn't have the same amount of detail that the previous avatar had.
  The loading system also got a bit of internal reworking in this update, meaning that some icons would have some loading issues, which is the main reason I
  recommend 1.50.0 over this update.

- 1.60.0 | ARGH! OUR SHIP IS SINKING MATEYS! I THINK WE MIGHT WRECK!

  Ahem - anyway, this update was one of the first with the Starlight Festival! This update also introduced the new in-game chat, although it's not a big deal anyway since
  this is in offline mode... Ooh! Also, this brought in Shipwreck Shore, replacing Barnacle Cove! This also has Pippet Battles!

- 1.70.0 | Huh I can dab now? Cool

  This update added in some quest progress popups for when you enter the following areas: Firefly Forest, Shiverchill Mountain, Skywatch, Bonfire Spire, and Shipwreck Shore.
  Pretty nifty, but is there anything significant- Also the Dark Tower got completely redesigned with a tileset model- COUNT ME IN!
  Oh and aside from all that stuff, you can dab now. Does that mean it's coming back- Also there's Winterfest, and 4 new epics are added in now. Pretty nifty.

- 1.80.0 | A battle overhaul!?

  Wow, that was quick- Huh. Ok - Anyway, the battle got changed a bit so that instead of having up to 4 pets, you only have up to 2. HOWEVER
  They are all on screen at the same time and the battle background uses tilesets now.

- 1.90.0 | Bunnies Vs. Foxes!

  The leaderboards got overhauled a bit and overall look way brighter than before. Also, the Dyno Dig Oasis quests are phased out now, Professor Scoog is now a shopkeeper.
  This version also includes some general stability improvements, and the first Springfest in Prodigy was also here. Also a lot of new music was added in!

- 2.6.0 | Another battle overhaul!

  What? Again? That was quick- Ah don't worry about it, that'll be the last major revision for the next 4 and a half years! Whew, thank goodness. Anyway, this marks a point
  where a lot of previously bitmap-based fonts start to get replaced by vector fonts. There are also a lot of more obscure and internal changes but who cares about that, the battle revision is the focus here. Anyway to go into more detail about the battle revision, basically everything has a LOT of health now, attacks do more damage, higher leveled players/pets are way more powerful, and relics and wands have spells associated with them rather than choosing them in a spellbook. The older spells also were completely phased out in favor of newer spells with smoother animation, but that's the gist.

 - 2.7.0 | Coming Soon!

 The New Academy is coming to Old Prodigy soon!

Pick any version you want!
