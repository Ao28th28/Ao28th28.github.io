Here are some coding projects I work on.
Right now I only have one public one. Old Prodigy.

## Old Prodigy

This is some pretty simple modding of older versions of Prodigy, to get them to work right now, in the present day!
If you want a little dose of nostalgia from older prodigy versions, no matter what the purpose - 
seeing the older battle systems, the older quests, or anything of the sort - 
then you know where you are, and you know what to do!

There are a lot of versions to choose from based on your preferences, covering YEARS worth of updates from Prodigy's team!

I am still actively working on bettering it, so if you have any problems with bugs, glitches, etc. Just make an issue
and I'll try to address it as soon as I can!

There are also forks of my mods. Check them out whenever you get the chance! They're awesome!

## How to play

Playing this couldn't be more simple. First thing you have to do is open the site, which is automatically updated from this
repository!

To do so, you just click this link: https://daboss7173.github.io/oldprodigy/select

Once you're there, you can select a version to play. There are LOTS of versions to choose from, so try not to be overwhelmed
by the amount of choices, and there are still more versions and updates to come!

Once you've selected a version, it'll take you to the login screen where you have 3 options. To create a new wizard, to start in offline mode,
or to load a previous save.

If you want to start a quick game and not configure how your character appears, you should choose offline mode.

If you want to start a new game and configure your character however you want, you should choose to create a new character.

If you want to load a character that you've already saved, you click load character and select your save file.

To save your character, you can just go into the settings menu, and go under 'network' and click the button called "save character". It'll automatically download
to your computer, for this I recommend manually choosing a folder to save it in so things can be more organized. If there is no network tab in the version
you're playing in, click the 'other' tab instead.

## Version choice breakdown!

Okay, maybe the versions are bit overwhelming. Let's break it down a bit!

- 1.11.0 | The oldest version that can run essentially flawlessly.
Now don't get me wrong, this isn't the oldest version of prodigy ever, but it's pretty dang old! Lots of old elements around that aren't seen in newer versions.
This was the last archived version to include some classic GUI elements.

- 1.16.5 | The oldest version with all of the legacy quests, and the element selection.
This is a version the I recommend in particular, it's kind of like 1.11.0 - but it's generally a lot more stable. In fact this version
is one of the most stable Prodigy versions on this site!

- 1.17.0 | The oldest version with tileset-style maps!
This version was the first to introduce a new tutorial, more in-depth than 1.16.5 and before, which would end up being used all the way up to 1.30.0!
Not only did this version have that, but it also introduced the precursor to the modern firefly forest (before they updated the tileset and updated Flora's sprite)

- 1.24.0 | A whole lot of stuff added in!
This version introduced the new Shiverchill Mountains quests, AND a new tile-based Lamplight town, as well as a LOT of new menu designs added in.
Pretty safe to say a LOT happened between 1.17.0, and this version.

- 1.30.0 | Just as many radical changes!
This version had the updated Skywatch, the updated Bonfire Spire, AND an updated map screen! This version also introduced achievements, and all kinds of
other, more subtle changes.

- 1.37.0 | New Lamplight Town and tutorial!
This version had a brand-new tutorial, which is the base for the MODERN DAY Prodigy tutorial, even though it's been changed in multiple ways, the resemblence is
uncanny! This also brought in the modern-style Lamplight Town, now some things are arranged differently, it's still essentially the same. This version
also has Winterfest, which is pretty cool if you're interested in that.

- 1.39.0 | Crazy battle update!?
This version introduced a refresh on the battle system, with a new health meter not using hearts, but a health bar! It also shows how much damage is dealt in
each attack, and introduced critical hits. This also has leveling up mid-battle and some new animations to accompany this! This version also has the Firefly Forest reskin,
which looks really cool!

- 1.50.0 | Lots of significant changes added in!
This version has a lot of significant changes, for starters EPIC ATTACKS are added now, along with some new battle sound effects! The tutorial route was also re-worked
a bit, and now it uses a shorter route that doesn't take you through Lamplight Square and is overall less drawn-out. This is yet another version I truely recommend,
in my opinion it is one of the definitive Prodigy versions.

- 1.51.0 | NEW AVATAR!? EW!
This update has always been a bit controversial.. The avatar was completely reworked in this version, and instead of using spritesheets, it used atlases. This means
that the animations could be a LOT smoother than before! However, it just plain didn't have the same amount of detail that the previous avatar had.
The loading system also got a bit of internal reworking in this update, meaning that some icons would have some loading issues, which is the main reason I
recommend 1.50.0 over this update.

- 1.60.0 | ARGH! OUR SHIP IS SINKING MATEYS! I THINK WE MIGHT WRECK!
Ahem - anyway this update was one of the first with the Starlight Festival! This update also introduced the new in-game chat, although it's not a big deal anyway since
this is in offline mode... Also new mailing system, also doesn't matter a whole lot since this is offline... Huh, well what is significant in this offline version. Oh, it's
a lot more stable than 1.51.0! That's something! Ooh! Also this brought in Shipwreck Shore, replacing Barnacle Cove! This also has Pippet Battles!

- 1.70.0 | Huh I can dab now? Cool
This update added in some quest progress popups for when you enter the following areas: Firefly Forest, Shiverchill Mountain, Skywatch, Bonfire Spire, Shipwreck Shore.
Pretty nifty, but is there anything significa- Also the Dark Tower got completely redesigned with a tileset model- COUNT ME IN!
Oh and aside from all that stuff, you can dab now. Does that mean it's coming bac- Also there's Winterfest, and 4 new epics are added in now. Pretty nifty.

- 1.80.0 | A battle overhaul!?
Wow that was quick- YOU HAVE SEEN NOTHING YET SONNY BOY! Huh. Ok - Anyway the battle got changed a bit so that instead of having up to 4 pets, you only have up to 2. HOWEVER
they are all on screen at the same time and the battle background uses tilesets now.

- 1.90.0 | Bunnies Vs. Foxes!
The leaderboards got overhauled a bit and overall looks way brighter than before. Also the Dyno Dig Oasis quests are phased out now, Professor Scoog is now a shopkeeper.
This version also includes some general stability improvements, and the first Springfest in Prodigy was also here.

- 2.6.0 | Another battle overhaul!
What? Again? That was quick- Ah don't worry about it, that'll be the last major revision for the next 4 and a half years! Whew, thank goodness. Anyway this marks a point
where a lot of previously bitmap based fonts start to get replaced by vector fonts. There are also a lot of more obscure and internal changes but who cares about that, the
battle revision is the focus here.
