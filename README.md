# Old Prodigy

Craftersshaft was the first coder to restore Old Prodigy (1.30.0). Unfortunately, it turned into a broken version of 1.30.0 (Prodigy Reborn 1.0 Version 1.30.R).

This is some pretty simple modding of older versions of Prodigy, to get them to work right now, in the present day!
If you want a little dose of nostalgia from older Prodigy versions, no matter what the purpose - 
seeing the older battle systems, the older quests, or anything of the sort - 
then you know where you are, and you know what to do!

There are a lot of versions to choose from based on your preferences, covering YEARS worth of updates from Prodigy's team!

I am still actively working on bettering it, so if you have any problems with bugs, glitches, etc. Just make an issue
and I'll try to address it as soon as I can!

For iPad users: Use a different device to load your save file.

For Xbox users: Play Daboss7173's Definitive Edition if you want your character saved in Microsoft Edge or use a different device if you want your character saved from open source versions of Old Prodigy in Microsoft Edge.

There are also forks of my mods. Check them out whenever you get the chance! They're awesome!

## But First Some Disclaimers

Lets get some of the obvious stuff out of the way. This was done by craftersshaft first with Prodigy Reborn, and was the inspiration for this
project.

Check them out!
https://github.com/craftersshaft/

If there's a problem with Daboss7173.github.io, Slappygig.github.io, or a fork of this repository, contact the person responsible for the fork. I don't recommend saving your character from Daboss7173's 1.10.0 or Slappygig's (Slappygig.github.io) 1.10.0 due to the loss of your housedata.

If there's a bug in this repository, click on the Send Feedback button in the Main Menu, go to the bug-reports channel and report any bugs. I'll try to fix it as soon as I can.

There are also various forks of this repository, you can check them out if you get the chance. I can not guarentee the quality of play
as much as I can here, but I can say they have some cool stuff you might like.

## How to play

Playing this couldn't be more simple. First thing you have to do is open the site, which is automatically updated from this
repository!

This is the fork that I most highly recommend checking out, as it is the most stable and has the most features. 

I also recommend Ao28th28's Fork.

To do so, you just click this link: https://xpmuser.github.io/oldprodigy/select or this link: https://ao28th28.github.io/oldprodigy/select

Once you're there, you can select a version to play. There are lots of versions to choose from, so try not to be overwhelmed
by the number of choices, and there are still more versions and updates to come!

Once you've selected a version, it'll take you to the login screen where you have 3 options. To create a new wizard, to start in offline mode,
or to load a previous save.

If you want to start a quick game and not configure how your character appears, you should choose offline mode, but in Spring 2015 versions, you have to click on the new wizard button and then the generate random button.

If you want to start a new game and configure your character however you want, you should choose to create a new character.

If you want to load a character that you've already saved, you click load character and select your save file.

To save your character, you can just go into the settings menu, go under 'network' and click the button called "save character". It'll automatically download
to your computer, For this I recommend manually choosing a folder to save it in so you can organize it as you need. If there is no network tab in the version
you're playing in, click the 'other' tab instead. You can also find the Save Character button in the "Other" options menu.

## Modpacks

This repository features dynamic modpacks, you'll be able to toggle mods as you see fit, and be able to combine multiple mods together for dynamic modpacks.

Address bar: ?mods=-insert mod here- or ?mods=-insert mod here-,-insert mod here-

"-insert mod here-" means the names of the mods from the modpacks.

Here's a list of available mods:
1. WalkSpeed
2. FastGameSpeed
3. RebalancedBattles
4. ImitationTitan
5. Mathless
6. Classic Faces

Some mods might work or not work in some versions.
